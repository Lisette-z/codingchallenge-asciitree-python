### Task: ASCII Tree 
In the following you can find a little explanation of how I solved the task.
1. First, I wrote down the upcoming questions: 
-	Which programming language is easy to install and easy to learn? 
-	With which one can the task be realised? 
-	Which sources can be helpful to learn about the syntax and solve the task?
-	What does a good readme contain?
-	How to create a GitHub repository?


2. Then I did online research to choose a programming language: After reading some articles, I decided to pick Python, because it`s one of the world's top languages used by developers and one of the easiest programming languages for beginners.


3. Third, I watched some Python beginner tutorials and read descriptions on how to install Python and PyCharm. 


4. Then I analysed the task in detail:
-	the program/script should take two values as input:

     1. number for the height of the tree
     2. parameter to indicate whether the tree should be drawn with a star on top of it
-	as symbols there are: star on top as “*”, tree as “X”, stem as “I” 
-	the number for the height of the tree defines the number of rows the tree has
-	there has to be some space on the left side of each row to center the tree, in row 1, 4 left spaces and then 1 “X”, in row 2, 3 left spaces and then 3 “X”, etc.


5.	After that, I implemented the program by watching some Python tutorials and searching for Python commands: 
-	tree algorithm with possibility to change the symbols for the star on top, the tree and the stem
-	made the tree algorithm take two values as input, an integer for the height and “y” for the star on top of the tree
-	to make it reusable, I converted the tree algorithm to a user-defined function
